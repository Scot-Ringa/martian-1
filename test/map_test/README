Tests for a pipeline with mapped calls.  It consists of a few simple stages
for basic operations (which are combined by pipelines to make others, while
keep the number of stages down).  It uses these operations to compute the mean
and standard deviation of two arrays, one provided statically and the other
produced by another stage.

map_test.json tests normal operation
